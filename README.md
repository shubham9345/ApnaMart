# ApnaMart
### Decription
ApnaMart is an e-commerce grocery platform that enables customers to conveniently purchase everyday essential products. The backend is developed using the Spring and Spring Boot frameworks and relies on a MySQL database for robust data management. To ensure secure user sessions, JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is employed, while Spring Security safeguards sensitive user data and protects the system from cyber threats. For efficient database operations, Hibernate is utilized to perform CRUD functions and HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is leveraged for complex queries. Additionally, Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is integrated to provide comprehensive backend logging, streamlining the debugging process and enhancing overall system maintainability.
